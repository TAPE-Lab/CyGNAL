# Example data

Add here your .txt of .fcs untransformed data from mass cytometry experiments.

All data should be pre-processed first before undertaking any of the steps in 
the workflow.

Preprocessing can be done immediatly after acquisition and before undergoing 
debarcoding.

* See on /Data some examples for compatible datasets
* Only thoroughly tested with Cytobank exports but there should be no reason it
wouldn't work with data from other platforms as long as it is formatted as 
outlined above.


## Some example data could go on Example folders

* maybe even could be referenced/used in the mini tutorial
